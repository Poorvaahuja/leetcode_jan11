## Q1 Maximum difference between node and ancestor
Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value v for which there exist different nodes a and b where v = |a.val - b.val| and a is an ancestor of b.
A node a is an ancestor of b if either: any child of a is equal to b or any child of a is an ancestor of b.
